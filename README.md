## 📌 Project Purpose

This project is designed to help learners practice and apply modern **JavaScript** fundamentals by building the interactive parts of an eCommerce website. The **backend** and **HTML/CSS** structure were prewritten by the course instructor. The main goal for the student (me) was to **implement the JavaScript logic** that powers key features of the site.

## 🧩 Features Implemented (JavaScript Only)

- Add to cart functionality
- Cart quantity updates
- Price calculation
- Product list rendering
- Local storage for cart persistence
- Checkout flow simulation (front-end only)

## 🧠 What I Learned

- DOM manipulation and event handling
- Modular JavaScript with `import/export`
- Working with local storage
- Structuring code for maintainability
- Debugging real-world JavaScript issues

## ⚠️ Credits & Copyright

This project is based on the tutorial by **Simon Bao** on the **SuperSimpleDev** YouTube channel.  
All HTML, CSS, and backend simulation files were provided as part of the course.
